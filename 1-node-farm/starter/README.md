This is a beginner project using Node.js, HTML, & CSS.

It features a simulated online shopping platform for groceries, where a user will browse items and add/remove them from a shopping cart.

Packages:
    Slugify -- 
    Nodemon -- Allows modification of the Node.js server while it's running

Here is the command to run the server locally:
    'npm start'

Future Actions:
    - Add shopping cart to display added/removed items.
    - Create dynamic price fluctuations to simulate market changes.
    - Add more synthetic data and pages to the store-front.
